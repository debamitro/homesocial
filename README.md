# homesocial
A simple in-home social network, suitable for young and old alike. This is just a very rough first draft and very few things work.

## Features

* No passwords - everything is based on trust (remember how there were no passwords for your computer at home)
* Served locally over your Wifi - you own all the data
* Very safe and secure since it does not hit the internet at all

## How to use

This is the most basic way, on the same machine

* cd server ; npm install ; ./create_db.sh ; node index.js
* cd client/web ; npm install ; node index.js
* go to http://localhost:3000 in your browser
